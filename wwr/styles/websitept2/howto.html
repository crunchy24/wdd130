        Welcome to my How To page!
        On this page I will be helping you with what you need help with for your plants. For this I will be teaching you how to know when to water a succulent plant. You first want to make sure that your plant is in a place where it will get enough sunlight. If your plant is extremely dry like dry as a bone go ahead and get a spray bottle and spray the dirt until it has enough water. I usually pour the water from the spray bottle into the dirt but you can do whatever you want. Then keep checking after your plant every few days. If you are going on a longer vacation make sure to water it before you go and you should be good to go. You do not want to water it often or it might kill the plant with too much water. The soil/dirt has to be absolutely dry as a bone in order for you to water it. Leave it out in the sun. Then enjoy! Hopefully that helps to keep your succulent plants alive. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about this at all. Thank You!
