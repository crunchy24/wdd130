      Welcome to my How To page. On this page I will be helping you with what you need help with for your plants.



For this I will be teaching you how to know when to water a succulent plant. Click on the picture to the left to watch the video. You first want to make sure that your plant is in a place where it will get enough sunlight. If your plant is extremely dry like dry as a bone go ahead and get a spray bottle and spray the dirt until it has enough water. I usually pour the water from the spray bottle into the dirt but you can do whatever you want. Then keep checking after your plant every few days. If you are going on a longer vacation make sure to water it before you go and you should be good to go. You do not want to water it often or it might kill the plant with too much water. The soil/dirt has to be absolutely dry as a bone in order for you to water it. Leave it out in the sun. Then enjoy! Hopefully that helps to keep your succulent plants alive. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about this at all. I hope you enjoyed this video. Thank You!





For this video on the right I will be showing you how to plant plants in your garden. First you will want to know where to put your flowers or plants. Find a spot in your yard that you would like to plant stuff in. Second, think about what colors you are wanting to do. Like a color scheme. If you are planting veggies that doesn’t matter if you have a color scheme. Third, once you know what color scheme you are going for, think about what plants will come in those colors. Fourth, once you know what you want, go to a store near you that is selling the flowers that you want. Just look around the store to see if they have the colors. Feel free to change the color scheme at any time you would like. Then once you get your plants start digging a hole into the ground and put in your plant. Then cover up the roots of your plants or if you did bulbs cover up the bulbs with the dirt then start to water them. Now all you have to do is wait and over time they will grow and they will be so pretty. I hope the video was helpful like always feel free to contact me with any questions you may have and I can do my best to answer them. Thank You!




For the video on the left I will be talking about winter sowing. How to start on your plants in the winter so then when spring comes around you can just go ahead and plant them. First, you want to get a lot of containers and milk jugs that you can keep in your house. Second, look for a large area/space in your house where you can keep all of your containers and milk jugs. Third, fill up half a milk jug with dirt and your container fill it up halfway with dirt also. Fourth, grab the seeds of the plants you are wanting and make sure you have enough containers to put them in. Fifth, make sure that the containers are in a spot with sunlight. Sixth, start planting and make holes in the dirt. Seventh, make sure to water your plants once you are done putting them in the dirt. You will want to make sure that your plants will stay nice and warm because if they get cold at all during the winter they will die so make sure that they are staying nice and warm. If you put them in a place by the door make sure to try to not open and close that door a lot. Keep a good eye on them and water them when needed then you are good to go.

        I am the yougest child out of 10.
        I have four brothers and five sisters.
        I am 18 years old.

        I created this website for one of my college classes. I came up with this idea because my mom loves flowers but always struggled with succulents. I have had luck so I hope this website is helpful!:)
